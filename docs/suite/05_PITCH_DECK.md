## Slide 2: The Problem
**Header:** Deep Tech is Broken.

*   **The Valley of Death:** Bringing a new drug or energy source to market takes 5-10 years and millions of dollars.
*   **VC Failure:** Traditional Venture Capital is structuraly unable to fund 10-year horizons. They optimize for 3-year SaaS exits.
*   **Liquidity Trap:** Patents are "negative assets" for inventors—they cost money to maintain and yield nothing until a sale.
*   **Verification Gap:** Investors can't verify complex science cheaply, so they don't invest.

## Slide 3: The Solution
**Header:** A Protocol for Liquid IP.

IdeaCapital transforms intellectual property from a static legal document into a programmable, liquid financial asset.

1.  **Verify:** AI & Zero-Knowledge Proofs validate novelty instantly and privately.
2.  **Legalize:** Arizona ABS structures create a compliant "Micro-Law Firm" for each invention.
3.  **Tokenize:** Future revenue streams are fractionalized into liquid Royalty Tokens.
4.  **Govern:** Liquid Democracy allows experts to curate the best ideas.

## Slide 4: The Product
**Header:** From Napkin Sketch to Liquid Asset.

*   **Step 1: Ingest.** Inventor uploads a voice note or sketch. AI structures it into a patent brief.
*   **Step 2: Fund.** Community backs the project with USDC via smart contracts.
*   **Step 3: Protect.** Funds are released to file the patent (IP-NFT).
*   **Step 4: Earn.** Licensing revenue flows back to the Vault and is distributed automatically to token holders.

## Slide 5: Unfair Advantage (The Moat)
**Header:** Why We Win.

*   **Technology:** Proprietary **ZK-Novelty Circuit** (Poseidon Hash) allows inventors to prove they had an idea without revealing it.
*   **Legal:** First-mover advantage in utilizing **Arizona Rule 31 (ABS)** to allow non-lawyer ownership of patent law firms.
*   **Execution:** Enterprise-grade **Rust Financial Engine** (The Vault) ensures 100% financial precision and security.
*   **Identity:** **Vib3 Protocol** creates a unique, unforgeable visual identity for every asset.

## Slide 6: The Market
**Header:** Awakening a $65 Trillion Giant.

*   **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Global IP Asset Class value is estimated at **$65 Trillion**.
*   **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** The $500B annual R&D spend in Biotech, Clean Energy, and Hardware.
