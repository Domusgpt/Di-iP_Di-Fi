# IdeaCapital: Investor Pitch Deck (March 2026)

---

## Slide 1: Title
**Headline:** IdeaCapital
**Subheadline:** The NASDAQ for Ideas.
**Visual:** A sleek, dark-mode mobile interface showing a "Verifiable Novelty" badge and a rising stock chart for a "Nuclear Fusion Reactor" patent.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Headline:** Innovation is Illiquid.
**Key Points:**
1.  **$65 Trillion Trap:** Intellectual Property (IP) is the world's most valuable asset class, yet 99% of it is "dead capital"—impossible to trade or leverage.
2.  **The Valley of Death:** Deep tech founders (biotech, energy) need 5-10 years of R&D. Venture Capital demands SaaS-like returns in 18 months.
3.  **Trust Deficit:** Investors cannot verify if an invention is truly novel without spending $50k on lawyers.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
**Headline:** Liquid IP + Verifiable Truth.
**Key Points:**
1.  **Tokenize:** We turn patents into **IP-NFTs** (on Story Protocol) and fractionalize their future revenue into **Royalty Tokens**.
2.  **Verify:** Our AI "Brain" uses **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to mathematically prove an invention's novelty without revealing its secrets.
3.  **Democratize:** Anyone can invest $50 in the next curing drug or fusion reactor.

---

## Slide 4: The Product
**Headline:** A Full-Stack Ecosystem for DeSci.
**Visual:** Three pillars (Vault, Brain, Face).
**Key Points:**
1.  **The Vault (Rust):** An institutional-grade financial engine that handles millions in dividends with strict legal compliance (Arizona ABS).
2.  **The Brain (AI/ZK):** Automated due diligence. It reads patents so you don't have to.
3.  **The Face (Flutter):** A consumer-grade mobile app. Investing in deep tech is now as easy as buying a meme coin.

---

## Slide 5: Business Model
**Headline:** Automated Compliance = Automated Revenue.
**Visual:** A flowchart showing $100 entering -> $2.50 Platform Fee, $20 Lawyer Fee, $77.50 Dividend.
**Key Points:**
1.  **Platform Fee:** We take a small percentage (e.g., 2.5%) of all capital raised and dividends distributed.
2.  **Legal Tech:** We partner with law firms to automate patent filings, taking a cut of the legal fees.
3.  **Governance:** **Reputation Tokens (REP)** incentivize expert curation, reducing our operational costs.

---

## Slide 6: Traction & Status
**Headline:** Built, Deployed, & Ready for Alpha.
**Status:** v0.5.2 (Alpha Candidate)
**Key Metrics:**
*   **Infrastructure:** Live on Google Cloud (Run, SQL, Pub/Sub).
*   **Blockchain:** Live on Polygon Amoy Testnet.
*   **Wallet:** Integrated with 50+ wallets via WalletConnect.
*   **Tech:** Custom Rust Merkle Trees + Circom ZK Circuits.
